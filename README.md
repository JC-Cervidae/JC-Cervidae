- 👋 Hi, I’m @JC-Cervidae, just call me JC.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning valuable coding skills in order to get a better job than what i've got now, which isn't too high of a bar. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning general coding through freecodecamp.org, but I started with SQL for a job interview originally.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any work I can learn from and get feedback on, i'm still a beginner to this but i'm working hard at learning. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me a message on Telegram @InfernoKnight with a short message on whats up and that you got my info from Github!
